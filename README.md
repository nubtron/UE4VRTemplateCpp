# UE4VRTemplateCpp
C++ translation of Epic Games' default VR template.

This translation tries to keep the closest possible function-to-function mapping between Blueprint and C++. The comments are the original ones from Epic Games. 

Tested on Vive.

Known issues:

* Teleport rotation doesn't always work. This issue exists in the original too.
* Teleport rotation jumps around at some angles. This issue exists in the original too.
